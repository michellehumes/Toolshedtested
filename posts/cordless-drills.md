## What to Look for When Buying a Cordless Drill

### Battery Voltage and Technology

Voltage directly impacts the power output of your drill, with 12V, 18V/20V, and 24V being the most common options. For most applications, 18V-20V provides the best balance of power and weight. Always choose lithium-ion batteries over older NiCad technology for better runtime, faster charging, and longer lifespan.

### Torque and Power Ratings

Torque, measured in inch-pounds (in-lbs), determines the drill's ability to drive screws and drill through tough materials. For light DIY work, 300-400 in-lbs is sufficient, while professionals should look for 500+ in-lbs. Pay attention to both max torque and unit watts out (UWO) ratings for a complete power picture.

### Chuck Type and Size

Most modern drills feature 1/2-inch keyless chucks that provide good bit retention and easy operation. Look for chucks with carbide inserts for better grip and longevity. Single-sleeve chucks are generally more convenient than double-sleeve designs.

### Clutch Settings

More clutch settings allow for finer torque control, preventing overdriving screws and stripping materials. Look for at least 15 settings for general use, with 20+ being ideal for precision work.

### Ergonomics and Weight

Consider the drill's balance, grip comfort, and overall weight, especially if you'll be using it for extended periods. A well-balanced 4-pound drill often feels lighter than a poorly designed 3-pound model.

### Battery System Compatibility

Choose a drill from a manufacturer whose battery system works across multiple tools. This allows you to build a complete cordless tool collection while sharing batteries and chargers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between 18V and 20V drills?

Despite the marketing terminology, 18V and 20V MAX systems are essentially equivalent. The difference lies in how voltage is measured—18V is the nominal voltage, while 20V MAX refers to the maximum voltage when fully charged. Both deliver similar performance levels.

### How long should a cordless drill battery last?

A quality lithium-ion battery should provide 2-5 years of regular use before noticeable capacity decline. Runtime depends on the application, but expect 1-4 hours of mixed drilling and driving from a fully charged battery. Heavy-duty applications will drain batteries faster than light DIY tasks.

### Can I use my cordless drill as a screwdriver?

Yes, cordless drills excel as screwdrivers when equipped with appropriate bits and proper clutch settings. The adjustable clutch prevents overdriving screws, while variable speed control allows for precise starts. Many users find a good cordless drill eliminates the need for a separate screwdriver for most applications.

### What's the advantage of brushless motors?

Brushless motors offer several benefits over traditional brushed motors: 25-50% longer runtime, increased motor life, more power in a compact size, and reduced maintenance since there are no brushes to wear out. While brushless drills cost more upfront, they typically provide better long-term value.

### Should I buy a drill with one or two batteries?

Two-battery kits offer significant advantages for regular users. While one battery is in use, the other can be charging, virtually eliminating downtime. Single-battery kits work fine for occasional use but can be frustrating for larger projects or professional applications.

## Final Verdict

After extensive testing, the **DeWalt 20V MAX XR DCD771C2** emerges as our top recommendation for most users. It delivers reliable performance, excellent build quality, and great value while being backed by DeWalt's extensive service network and tool ecosystem. For professionals requiring maximum power, the **Milwaukee M18 Fuel 2804-20** is worth the extra investment, while budget-conscious DIYers will find excellent value in the **Ryobi P1813 18V ONE+**.

Remember that the best cordless drill is the one that matches your specific needs and usage patterns. Consider your typical projects, required runtime, and budget when making your decision. Regardless of which model you choose from our top five, you'll have a reliable tool that will serve you well for years to come.
