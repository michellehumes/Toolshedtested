# Affiliate Disclosure

**Last Updated: December 5, 2025**

ToolShedTested.com ("we," "us," or "our") believes in transparency with our readers. This disclosure explains how we fund our operations and how affiliate relationships work on this website.

## How We Make Money

ToolShedTested is a participant in affiliate advertising programs designed to provide a means for websites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to retail websites.

### Amazon Associates Program

ToolShedTested.com is a participant in the **Amazon Services LLC Associates Program**, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases. When you click on Amazon links on our site and make a purchase, we may receive a small commission at no additional cost to you.

### Other Affiliate Partnerships

We may also participate in affiliate programs with:
- Home Depot
- Lowe's
- Acme Tools
- Direct manufacturer programs

## Our Promise to You

**Independence First**: No tool manufacturer has ever paid us for a review, and none ever will. We purchase all tools at retail prices with our own money. Our recommendations are based solely on our hands-on testing and honest evaluation.

**Honest Reviews**: Affiliate relationships do not influence our review scores, rankings, or recommendations. We frequently recommend products that offer lower commissions or no commission at all if they provide better value to our readers.

**Full Transparency**: We clearly mark affiliate links throughout our content. When you see "Check Price on Amazon" or similar calls-to-action, these are affiliate links.

## How Affiliate Links Work

1. You click an affiliate link on our website
2. A cookie is placed in your browser (typically lasting 24 hours to 30 days)
3. If you make a purchase during that window, we receive a small commission
4. The price you pay remains exactly the same—you're never charged more for using our links

## What We Use Affiliate Revenue For

The commissions we earn support:
- Purchasing tools for testing (we've invested over $50,000)
- Website hosting and maintenance
- Research and writing time
- Photography and video production
