# Best Cordless Hedge Trimmers (2025) - 6 Models Tested

A good hedge trimmer transforms a dreaded chore into a quick task. After testing six of the most popular cordless models on boxwood, privet, and overgrown holly hedges, we found clear winners for different needs.

## Quick Picks

- **Best Overall:** DeWalt DCHT820B - Powerful cuts, great balance

- **Best Lightweight:** BLACK+DECKER LHT2220 - Just 5.4 lbs

## 1. DeWalt DCHT820B - Best Overall

The DeWalt strikes the perfect balance between power and maneuverability. Its 22-inch dual-action blade slices through 3/4-inch branches effortlessly, and the laser-cut, hooked-tooth design grips branches instead of pushing them away.

- Max Cut Thickness: 3/4 inch
- Battery: 20V MAX (not included)
- Weight: 7.5 lbs (bare tool)

**Pros:** Excellent cutting power, comfortable grip, part of huge DeWalt 20V ecosystem

## 3. Milwaukee M18 FUEL - Best for Thick Branches

## Buying Guide

### Blade Length
- **18-20 inches:** Ideal for small hedges and detailed shaping
- **22-24 inches:** Best all-around for most homeowners
- **26+ inches:** Faster for long, straight hedges

### Battery Compatibility
Check if the trimmer uses batteries from tools you already own. Most major brands (DeWalt, Milwaukee, Makita, Ryobi) keep batteries compatible across their lineups.

## FAQ

**Q: Cordless vs. corded hedge trimmers?**
A: Cordless wins for convenience. Modern batteries provide 45-60 minutes of runtime—plenty for most yards.

**Q: How often should I sharpen the blades?**
A: Most homeowners can go 2-3 seasons between sharpenings. Clean sap off blades after each use to extend life.
