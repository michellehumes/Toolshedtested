When you click our links and make purchases, we may earn a commission at no additional cost to you. This helps us keep the site running and continue producing honest reviews.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
                <p>Toolshed Tested is a participant in various affiliate marketing programs, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Amazon Associates Program:</strong> As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases. Amazon offers a commission on products purchased through our affiliate links.</li>
                    <li><strong>Home Depot Affiliate Program:</strong> We may earn commissions on purchases made through links to Home Depot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Direct Brand Partnerships:</strong> Some tool manufacturers have direct affiliate programs that we participate in.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What This Means for You</h2>
                <p>When you click on a product link on our site and make a purchase:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You pay the exact same price you would pay if you went directly to the retailer</li>
                    <li>We receive a small percentage of the sale as a commission</li>
                    <li>This commission helps fund our testing, research, and content creation</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Editorial Independence</h2>
                <p>Despite participating in affiliate programs, our reviews remain completely independent:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>We buy most products ourselves:</strong> Approximately 80% of the tools we review are purchased at full retail price with our own money.</li>
                    <li><strong>No pay-for-play:</strong> We never accept payment in exchange for positive reviews. Ever.</li>
                    <li><strong>Honest assessments:</strong> If a product is bad, we say so—even if it means losing potential commissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Best picks, not highest commissions:</strong> Our recommendations are based on quality and value, not commission rates.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Transparency Commitment</h2>
                <p>We believe in full transparency with our readers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Affiliate links are clearly marked or disclosed on relevant pages</li>
                    <li>Sponsored content (if any) is always clearly labeled</li>
                    <li>We disclose when products are received for review purposes</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Display Advertising</h2>
                <p>In addition to affiliate commissions, we may display advertisements on our site through advertising networks like Google AdSense, Mediavine, or Ezoic. These ads are served based on your browsing history and interests, and we have no control over specific ads shown.</p>
