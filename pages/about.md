## About Toolshed Tested

We're passionate about tools and dedicated to helping you find the right equipment for your projects. Our team tests each tool thoroughly, providing honest and detailed reviews to guide your purchasing decisions.

## Our Mission

Too many "review" sites just rewrite Amazon descriptions. We actually buy the tools, use them on real projects, and tell you what works and what doesn't.

## How We Test

### We Buy Everything
We purchase every product we review at full retail price. No freebies, no sponsored content, no bias.

### Real-World Testing
Our testing happens in actual backyards, driveways, and job sites - not sterile labs. If a pressure washer can't handle real mildew, you'll know.

### Long-Term Use
We don't just unbox and review. We use products for weeks or months to find issues that only show up over time.

### Side-by-Side Comparisons
We test competing products head-to-head under identical conditions so you can see real differences.

## Our Team

We're a small team of DIY enthusiasts, contractors, and gear nerds with over 20 years of combined experience in outdoor power equipment.
