## Buying Guide: What to Look for in a Cordless Hedge Trimmer

### Battery Voltage and Capacity

Battery voltage typically ranges from 18V to 80V, with higher voltages generally providing more cutting power. However, don't overlook amp-hour (Ah) capacity, which determines runtime. A 20V 5.0Ah battery often outperforms a 40V 2.0Ah battery in real-world use.

### Blade Length and Type

Blade lengths range from 16 to 26 inches. Longer blades cover more ground but are harder to maneuver in tight spaces. Dual-action blades (where both sides move) cut faster and with less vibration than single-action designs.

### Cutting Capacity

This measurement indicates the maximum branch diameter the trimmer can handle. Most models cut 1/2 to 1 inch branches, with 3/4-inch being adequate for most residential needs.

### Weight and Ergonomics

Extended use makes weight crucial. Look for models under 9 pounds with well-balanced designs. Features like wrap-around handles, cushioned grips, and low vibration significantly impact comfort.

### Motor Type

Brushless motors offer 25% longer runtime, increased power, and extended tool life compared to brushed alternatives. They're worth the extra cost for regular users.

### Safety Features

Quality hedge trimmers include blade guards, two-handed operation requirements, and quick-stop brakes that halt blade movement within seconds of releasing the trigger.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long do cordless hedge trimmer batteries typically last?

Runtime varies from 30 to 90 minutes depending on battery capacity, cutting load, and blade size. Most homeowners find 45-60 minutes sufficient for typical hedge maintenance. Battery life (total lifespan) typically ranges from 3-5 years with proper care.

### Can cordless hedge trimmers handle thick branches?

Modern cordless models can cut branches up to 1 inch thick, with most handling 3/4-inch branches easily. For branches thicker than your trimmer's capacity, use hand pruners or a reciprocating saw to avoid damaging the blade.

### How do I maintain my cordless hedge trimmer?

Clean debris from blades after each use, apply light oil to prevent rust, and store batteries at room temperature. Sharpen or replace blades annually for best performance. Check blade bolts periodically to ensure they remain tight.

### Are cordless hedge trimmers as powerful as gas models?

Today's high-voltage cordless models (56V+) deliver power comparable to gas trimmers while offering instant starts, no mixing fuel, and significantly less maintenance. For most residential applications, cordless performance now matches or exceeds gas alternatives.

### What's the difference between single-action and dual-action blades?

Single-action blades have one moving blade against a stationary one, while dual-action blades have both sides moving in opposite directions. Dual-action designs cut faster, create less vibration, and produce cleaner cuts, making them the preferred choice for most users.

## Final Verdict

The DeWalt DCHT820P1 emerges as our top overall choice, delivering the ideal combination of power, runtime, and professional build quality that satisfies both demanding homeowners and landscaping professionals. However, each model on our list excels in specific areas: the Milwaukee offers maximum cutting capacity, the Makita provides the best power-to-weight ratio, the EGO delivers gas-like performance, and the BLACK+DECKER offers solid value for budget-conscious buyers. Consider your specific needs, hedge types, and frequency of use when making your selection, and you'll enjoy years of efficient, cord-free hedge maintenance.
