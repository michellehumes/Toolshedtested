## Affiliate Disclosure

Toolshed Tested is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

## What This Means For You

When you click on product links on our site and make a purchase on Amazon, we may receive a small commission. **This comes at no additional cost to you** - you pay the same price whether you use our links or not.

## Our Editorial Independence

**Our affiliate relationships do not influence our product recommendations.**

We recommend products based on:
- Our hands-on testing experience
- Build quality and durability
- Performance and value
- User reviews and feedback

We frequently recommend products that don't have the highest commission rates because they're simply the best tools for the job.

## Products We Buy

Many of the tools we review are purchased with our own money. We do this to:
- Maintain complete editorial independence
- Test products as a real customer would
- Avoid any bias from manufacturer relationships

## How Affiliate Links Work

1. You click a product link on our site
2. You're taken to Amazon.com
3. If you make a purchase, we earn a small percentage
4. You pay the exact same price

## Questions?

If you have any questions about our affiliate relationships or review process, please contact us at hello@toolshedtested.com.
